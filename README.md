## Hi there 👋, I’m Roseantic, 
a final-year Computer Science engineering student at Cambridge Institute of Technology 💻, passionate about problem-solving and learning new technologies. I enjoy taking on real-world challenges, leveraging my analytical skills and a data-driven approach to create impactful solutions.  

Outside academics, I love playing badminton 🏸, traveling ✈️, and exploring my creative side through art, craft, calligraphy, and painting 🎨. I’m also a foodie 🍕 who enjoys discovering new cuisines.  

Being part of TEDxCIT has been a transformative experience for me. It has helped me step out of my comfort zone, connect with more people, and grow into a confident and socially engaged individual. TEDx has not only allowed me to contribute to impactful events but also helped me discover the power of collaboration and meaningful conversations.  

I’m also an astrophile ✨, fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. I believe in building meaningful connections, staying curious, and leaving a positive impact on everything I do. 🚀
