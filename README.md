## Hi there 👋, I’m Roseantic
A final-year Computer Science engineering student at Cambridge Institute of Technology 💻, passionate about problem-solving and learning new technologies. I enjoy tackling real-world challenges with an analytical and data-driven approach.

Outside academics, I love badminton 🏸, traveling ✈️, and exploring my creativity through art and calligraphy 🎨. I’m also a foodie 🍕 who enjoys discovering new cuisines.

Being part of TEDxCIT has helped me step out of my comfort zone, connect with people, and grow into a more confident individual. I’m also an astrophile ✨, fascinated by the universe and its mysteries.

I believe in staying curious, building meaningful connections, and making a positive impact. 🚀
